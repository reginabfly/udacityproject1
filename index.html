                    <h4 class="portfolio-header">Pixel Art Maker</h4>
                    <p>This was the final project in my three month Grow with Google Scholarship through Udacity for Front End Web Development. We had to build this application utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. I took it one step further and utilized flexbox in CSS to make it responsive. This project helped me utilize my knowledge I learned in the class for JavaScript and jQuery and also allowed me to test out flexbox for the first time.</p>

                    <h4 class="portfolio-header">Website Design</h4>
                    <p>This is a website that I created for a local piano teacher in my town. She expressed an interest on getting her own website up but didn't have any idea on how to make that happen. I created this website for her in 2017 to practice what I was learning online in my courses utilizing HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4. This project helped me learn how to take what I learned as a new developer and apply it to a real world website. </p>

                    <h4 class="portfolio-header">Color Picker Game</h4>
                    <p>I created this game while working through the course at Udemy called Colt Steel's Web Development Bootcamp. I was working through the JavaScript section of the course and utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this fun and eye appealing game. At the top of the game, there is an RGB code. You have to click on the image that you think matches that RBG color value. When you do, all the blocks turn to the correct color.</p>
